		<p id="welcome">Jacqueline (Jackie) is from Farmington Hills Michigan and works at her dad's aviation maintenance company. She is an alumna of Mercy High School and the Univerisity of Michigan, where she earned her Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Jackie became interested in coding in the summer of 2017, first with some online coding tutorials and then a couple workshops at Grand Circus, which ultimately led her to take the plunge and apply to bootcamp. When she's not coding, Jackie enjoys spending time with her family, friends, and pets.</p>
